I'm mint and I'm a game developer & designer. I want to make beautiful ideas real, and I value playfulness above all else.

This site is a portfolio of the works Iâ€™ve contributed to and created, and is always being updated with new items. "mint" is the pseudonym I go by and what I publish my works under. <!--The bottom portrait is one of the icons that usually accompany the name.-->

Creating games is my love but I enjoy taking on any design challenge. I primarily use Unity (C#), Python, or Unreal (C++) but I first started making games in JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas (using [SplatJS](https://splatjs.github.io/).) I also co-founded the Louisville game dev organization [Louisville Makes Games](http://louisvillemakesgames.org), the co-working space [Warp Zone](http://louisvillemakesgames.org/warpzone), and the local developer group [GameDevLou](https://github.com/GameDevLou). My games may tip you off that I love strong stylization.
