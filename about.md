I'm mint and I'm an independent designer & game developer. I want to create beauty in the world. This site is a portfolio of the works Iâ€™ve contributed to and created, and is always being updated with new items. "mint" is the pseudonym I go by and what I publish my works under. The bottom picture to the left is the icon that usually accompanies the name.

Making games is my passion but I enjoy taking on any design challenge. I primarily use Unity and C# (occasionally Python) but the earlier games in my portfolio were made in JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas (using [SplatJS](https://splatjs.github.io/).) I also co-founded the Louisville game dev organization [Louisville Makes Games](http://louisvillemakesgames.org), the co-working space [Warp Zone](http://louisvillemakesgames.org/warpzone), and the local group [GameDevLou](https://github.com/GameDevLou). My game names may tip you off that I love stylized titles.
