I'm mint and I'm an independent designer & game developer. I want to create, and make things more beautiful. This site is a portfolio of the works I’ve contributed to and created, and is always being updated with new items. "mint" is the pseudonym I go by and what I publish my works under. The bottom picture to the left is the icon that usually accompanies the name.

Making games is my passion but I enjoy taking on any design challenge. I primarily use Unity and C# (occasionally Python) but the earlier games in my portfolio were made in JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas (using <a href="http://splatjs.com">Splat</a>.) I also co-founded the Louisville game dev organization <a href="http://louisvillemakesgames.org">Louisville Makes Games</a>, the co-working space <a href="http://louisvillemakesgames.org/warpzone">Warp Zone</a>, and the local group <a href="http://gamedevlou.org">GameDevLou</a>. My game names may tip you off that I love stylized titles.

I’m also semi-nomadic and have a <a href="https://patreon.com/mint">Patreon</a> for writing about my travels.
