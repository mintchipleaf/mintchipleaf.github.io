I'm mint and I'm an independent designer & game developer. I want to create, and make things more beautiful. This site is a portfolio of the works I’ve contributed to and created, and is always being updated with new items. "mint" is the pseudonym I go by and what I publish my works under. The bottom picture to the left is the icon that usually accompanies the name.

<br/>
Making games is my passion but I enjoy taking on any design challenge. I primarily use Unity and C# (occasionally Python) but the earlier games in my portfolio were made in JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas (using [Splat](http://splatjs.com).) I also co-founded the Louisville game dev organization [Louisville Makes Games](http://louisvillemakesgames.org), the co-working space [Warp Zone](http://louisvillemakesgames.org/warpzone), and the local group [GameDevLou](http://gamedevlou.org). My game names may tip you off that I love stylized titles.

<br/>
I’m also semi-nomadic and have a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/mint) for writing about my travels.
